## about me

### <i class="bi bi-rewind-btn-fill"></i> past

I began my professional career as a secondary-level mathematics instructor in Alpine School District, UT. During my eight year tenure I taught algebra, statistics, geometry, and calculus to adolescent learners, specializing in those that historically "disagreed" with math. In addition to serving as the mathematics department chair for three years, I coached the school's first esports team in their inaugural season of Rocket League. **Go Falcons!**

I next joined the remote workforce as a capstone evaluator for learners within WGU's mathematics education programs. A renewed interest in computer science led to my transition into program development for the College of IT where I designed innovative hybrid coding summative assessments in Python, SQL, and Java. Concurrently, I earned a data analytics degree to complement my mathematics background.

At the start of 2023 I joined the profession of analytics as a business analyst with WGU's Service Design and Innovation administrative team, tasked with creating alternative pathways for WGU's prospective students. I explored data and built custom executive reports & dashboards to provide atypical reporting on WGU innitiatives. I collaborated with project managers, directors, deans, vice-presidents, and other data professionals to provide ad-hoc analytics with quickly evolving priorities. 

### <i class="bi bi-play-btn-fill"></i> present

I am an analyst & educator, highly skilled in the bidirectional transfer of knowledge with stakeholders of diverse backgrounds and age groups. I specialize in defining surrounding knowledge & processes while promoting an atmosphere of shared understanding. 

### <i class="bi bi-fast-forward-btn-fill"></i> future

Unfortunately, a 2023 reduction in staff led to layoffs for the majority of my team at WGU, myself included. I am currently seeking a new opportunity to apply my skills and experience in a new environment. I excel at learning, am hungry to improve, and have the technical skill to not just identify issues but to implement solutions.

### Netflix Content Analysis

[![](resources\portfolio_netflix-content-analysis.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of a data coding notebook."}](https://crossinguard.github.io/netflix-content-analysis/)

Preparation of Netflix data for use in a Tableau dashboard. VS Code was used to create a `.qmd` Quarto document, which employs markdown and code blocks similar to a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Quarto uses [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert the `.qmd` document into an HTML file, which in turn can be customized visually using CSS and Bootstrap variables. The end result is a human-readable source document that is highly adaptable and cabable of displaying complex information. <br><br> [<i class="bi bi-globe2"></i> project website](https://crossinguard.github.io/netflix-content-analysis/)<br>[<i class="bi bi-github"></i> github repo](https://github.com/crossinguard/netflix-content-analysis)
