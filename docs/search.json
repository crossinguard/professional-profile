    "text": "about me\n\npast\nI began my professional career as a secondary-level mathematics instructor in Alpine School District, UT. During my eight year tenure I taught algebra, statistics, geometry, and calculus to adolescent learners, specializing in those that historically “disagreed” with math. In addition to serving as the mathematics department chair for three years, I coached the school’s first esports team in their inaugural season of Rocket League. Go Falcons!\nI next joined the remote workforce as a capstone evaluator for learners within WGU’s mathematics education programs. A renewed interest in computer science led to my transition into program development for the College of IT where I designed innovative hybrid coding summative assessments in Python, SQL, and Java. Concurrently, I earned a data analytics degree to complement my mathematics background.\nAt the start of 2023 I joined the profession of analytics as a business analyst with WGU’s Service Design and Innovation administrative team, tasked with creating alternative pathways for WGU’s prospective students. I explored data and built custom executive reports & dashboards to provide atypical reporting on WGU innitiatives. I collaborated with project managers, directors, deans, vice-presidents, and other data professionals to provide ad-hoc analytics with quickly evolving priorities.\n\n\npresent\nI am an analyst & educator, highly skilled in the bidirectional transfer of knowledge with stakeholders of diverse backgrounds and age groups. I specialize in defining surrounding knowledge & processes while promoting an atmosphere of shared understanding.\n\n\nfuture\nUnfortunately, a 2023 reduction in staff led to layoffs for the majority of my team at WGU, myself included. I am currently seeking a new opportunity to apply my skills and experience in a new environment. I excel at learning, am hungry to improve, and have the technical skill to not just identify issues but to implement solutions."

A csv file of data was imported as a dataframe/tibble using R and the tidyverse collection of data science packages. Data quality issues regarding columns with multi-value elements, column datatypes, date formats, misplaced values, and column splitting were addressed during this process. The resulting clean data was exported for use in a Tableau dashboard for further analysis.\nHOW?\nVS Code was used to create a Quarto technical document, which employs markdown and code blocks similar to a Jupyter coding notebook. Pandoc was used to render the markdown-based document into an HTML file. Custom styling occurred using Sass with CSS and Bootstrap. The end result is a human-readable source document that is highly adaptable and cabable of displaying complex information.\n\n project website\n github repo\n\n\n\nData Dashboard\nAccompanying Tableau dashboard coming soon!\n\nTableau csv datasource\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipe Book\n\nDigital recipe book for personal use.
