    "text": "about me\n\npast\nI began my professional career as a secondary-level mathematics instructor in Alpine School District, UT. During my eight year tenure I taught algebra, statistics, geometry, and calculus to adolescent learners, specializing in those that historically “disagreed” with math. In addition to serving as the mathematics department chair for three years, I coached the school’s first esports team in their inaugural season of Rocket League. Go Falcons!\nI next joined the remote workforce as a capstone evaluator for learners within WGU’s mathematics education programs. A renewed interest in computer science led to my transition into program development for the College of IT where I designed innovative summative assessments for fundamental coding courses (e.g., Python, SQL, Java). Concurrently, I earned a data analytics degree to complement my mathematics background.\nAt the start of 2023 I joined the profession of analytics as a business analyst with WGU’s Service Design and Innovation administrative team, tasked with creating alternative pathways for WGU’s prospective students. I explored data and built custom executive reports & dashboards to provide atypical reporting on WGU initiatives. I collaborated with project managers, directors, deans, vice-presidents, and other data professionals to provide ad-hoc analytics with quickly evolving priorities.\n\n\npresent\nI am an analyst & educator, highly skilled in the bidirectional transfer of knowledge with stakeholders of diverse backgrounds, technical knowledge, and age groups. I specialize in defining surrounding knowledge & processes while promoting an atmosphere of shared understanding.\n\n\nfuture\nUnfortunately, a 2023 reduction in staff led to layoffs for the majority of my team at WGU, myself included. I am currently seeking a new opportunity to apply my skills and experience in a new environment. I excel at learning new tools & processes, am hungry to improve, and have the technical skill to not just identify issues but to implement solutions."

Data quality issues regarding columns with multi-value elements, incorrect datatypes & date formats, misplaced values, and column splitting were addressed during this process.\nThe resulting clean data was exported to use in a Tableau dashboard for further analysis. The following are sample business questions that could be examined using this dashboard.\n\nHow has the average duration of movies and TV shows on Netflix evolved each decade (by release year)?\nAre there certain months when more content is added to Netflix? Does that differ between content types?\nWhat is the distribution of content by ratings (e.g., PG, PG-13, R)? Does that vary by country of origin?\n\n\n\nTools\nA Quarto .qmd technical document, which employs markdown and functional code blocks similar to a Jupyter coding notebook, was created within VS Code. A csv file of data was imported as a dataframe/tibble using R and the tidyverse collection of data science packages.\nAt the conclusion of the data preparation process, multiple clean csv files were exported for use as datasources in a Tableau Public dashboard. Pandoc was then used to convert the markdown-based .qmd document into an HTML file, with custom styling occurring through Sass with CSS and Bootstrap. The end result is a human-readable source document that is highly adaptable and cabable of displaying complex information.\n\n\n\n\nRecipe Book\n\n project website\n github repo\n\n\n\nprocess mapping transfer of knowledge Quarto Markdown CSS Sass Bootstrap\n\n\nAbout\nDigital recipe book for personal use.
